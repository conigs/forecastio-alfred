This extension checks the [Dark Sky](http://darkskyapp.com/) [API](https://developer.darkskyapp.com/) for the weather with the command `now`, providing you with the current temperature, conditions, and what to expect for the next hour. Using the command `today` or `tomorrow` will give you the outlook for the next 24 hours.

To configure the extension for your area, [look up the coordinates](http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php) for your address and enter them as `LAT` and `LON` in the extension settings. Alfred displays the weather using Notification Center. If out of the box, itâ€™s not showing you anything when you submit the command, check that your Alfred settings have Extension Output selected.
